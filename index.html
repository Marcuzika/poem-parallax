                Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
                Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.

                Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
                Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
                And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.

                Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
                Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

                And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
                Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
